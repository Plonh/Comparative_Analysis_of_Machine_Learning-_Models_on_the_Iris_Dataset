# Comparative_Analysis_of_Machine_Learning-_Models_on_the_Iris_Dataset


#Project Overview: 

 The aim of this project is to in both supervised and unsupervised machine learning tasks using the 
famous Iris dataset. The project involves two main tasks:

1.Unsupervised Learning: Clustering and outlier detection on the dataset.
 2.Supervised Learning: Building baseline models, comparing multiple algorithms, tuning the best-performing model, and evaluating it against an ensemble of 
algorithms.

Dataset: 

Iris Dataset
 â€¢ The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, containing 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length, 
sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a target variable specifying the iris species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica).
